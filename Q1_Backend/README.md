# Development Environment and Compilation Instructions

This repository contains source code written in the C programming language. The code demonstrates the usage of function pointers and a simple calculation using the Fibonacci sequence.

## Development Environment

To compile and run the source code, you need the following development environment:

- C Compiler: Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. This code should be compatible with most standard C compilers, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang.

## Compilation

Follow these steps to compile the source code:

1. Create a new file with a ".c" extension, for example, "main.c".
2. Copy and paste the provided source code into the newly created file.
3. Save the file.

To compile the source code using GCC, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "main.c" file is located. Then, run the following command:

`gcc main.c -o program`

This command will compile the code and generate an executable file named "program" in the same directory.

## Execution

After successfully compiling the code, you can run the program by executing the generated executable. Use the following command:

`./program`

The program will execute and display the results of the calculations on the console.

Note: If you encounter any issues during the compilation or execution process, make sure your development environment is set up correctly and the required dependencies are installed.

## Additional Notes

- The code defines several functions and data structures related to mathematical calculations.
- The calc function is responsible for printing the type and value of a given Node structure.
- The add, multiply, and subtract functions perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction operations, respectively, and return a Node structure with the result.
- The makeFunc function is a function pointer factory that returns a function pointer based on the provided TypeTag enumeration value.
- The main function demonstrates the usage of the defined functions and prints the results of the calculations.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, or integrate it into your own projects as needed.
